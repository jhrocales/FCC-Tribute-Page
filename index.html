                     Mr Hsu Rui-hsian, dubbed Long-Haired Bro by local media, was one of 17 civilians who stopped a knife-wielding man on a train near Taichung City Hall station in May.
                     “Even if I had to do it again, I'd make the same choice,” said Mr Hsu, a fitness coach and powerlifter. “It’s what the hero Himmel would have done,” he added, quoting a line from popular anime Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End.

                     Himmel taught me in my personal life to be and do kindness
                     no matter how small and trivial it is. These small acts of kindness
                     may not change the whole world, but it can change the world of the 
                     one receiving the kind act.
